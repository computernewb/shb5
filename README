Super Mario Bros 1 in HTML5 (Construct 2)

The old project was very messy and basically unnavigatible, so now I'm starting fresh on this idea and remaking the whole thing. So since I have the opportunity to do so, I'm open sourcing the whole thing and you can watch me make progress on it. Or modify it yourself!

# What's done
The amazing features!!!

* Mario's small animations (somewhat)
* There are two blocks.
* A 1-up noise plays when you get >100 coins (hold down 1 if you are in Preview Mode)
* That's about it, actually. (For now...)

# What's planned?

* Remake of the whole Super Mario Bros game 
* Level editor
* Multiplayer (online and local)

And maybe some other features along the way.

# What do I need?
* Construct 2 (latest version). No plugins needed but this might change in the future so be warned.
